He\r\nset up every day along a busy walking\r\nstreet in Nicosia, Cyprus. Most of his money\r\nwent to buy cigarettes and alcohol. A decade\r\nearlier, Yulian had immigrated to southern\r\nCyprus from Bulgaria to look for a job.\r\n<\/p><p>One day, Filip, a Global Mission pioneer\r\nalso from Bulgaria, walked by and greeted\r\nYulian, asking if he needed any help.\r\n<\/p><p>Yulian was surprised. No one had asked\r\nhim such a question in a long time. It was\r\nnice to hear someone taking an interest in\r\nhim and speaking his native language, but\r\nYulian didn\u2019t answer the question and just\r\noffered him a shoe shine.\r\n<\/p><p>While Yulian shined his shoes, Filip told\r\nhim that Jesus loves each one of us no matter\r\nwhat situation we\u2019re in. The mention of Jesus\r\ngrabbed Yulian\u2019s attention.\r\n<\/p><p class=\"p3\">[[$gallery]]<\/p><p>The next day, Filip returned and asked\r\nagain if Yulian needed any help. Yulian was\r\nsurprised the stranger had returned. This\r\ntime Filip didn\u2019t need a shoe shine, so they \r\n\t<span class=\"redactor-invisible-space\">just talked for a while and looked through\r\nthe books that he brought. This became a\r\nroutine. \r\n\t<\/span>\r\n<\/p><p><span class=\"redactor-invisible-space\">Sometimes Filip read the Bible to Yulian,\r\nand eventually, the shoe shiner opened up\r\nabout how he\u2019d worked in construction after\r\narriving with his family in Cyprus. He lost his\r\njob and was kicked out of his home for drinking. His family and friends had rejected him. \r\n\t<\/span>\r\n<\/p><p><span class=\"redactor-invisible-space\">One day, Yulian led his new friend to the\r\nabandoned building where he slept. His bed\r\nwas a hard floor. The sight brought tears to\r\nFilip\u2019s eyes, and they prayed together on the\r\nstreet. \r\n\t<\/span>\r\n<\/p><p><span class=\"redactor-invisible-space\">Yulian felt valued and felt God\u2019s love\r\nthrough the pioneer\u2019s actions. It was at that\r\npoint that he gave his life to God. \r\n\t<\/span>\r\n<\/p><p><span class=\"redactor-invisible-space\">Although he\u2019d drunk heavily for 35 years,\r\nYulian decided to give up alcohol that day.\r\nAnd although he had smoked heavily as well,\r\nhe quit a week later. His family welcomed him \r\n\t<span class=\"redactor-invisible-space\">back home, and now he tells everyone\r\nwho will listen about his love for God. \r\n\t<\/span><\/span>\r\n<\/p><p><span class=\"redactor-invisible-space\"><span class=\"redactor-invisible-space\">Filip regularly leads a Bulgarian-language Bible study. Over three years,\r\neight people were baptized through\r\nFilip\u2019s work, a significant number for a\r\ncountry where the Adventist Church has\r\nonly about 100 members in a population of more than one million.
